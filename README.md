The code included in this repository is for the Zoara game **server** (powered by SmartFoxServer2x) and NOT the game **client** (built in Unity3D). The two projects were developed relatively independently and are deployed in very different ways, so it didn't make sense to me to publish the two together as a whole. Also, for the time being, I am unable to publish and open-source the code for the Zoara client because the project included several packages that I purchased from the Unity store, and which I am therefore prohibited from publishing under my name. Once I have some time, I'll try to go through and piece together which bits are my own code and which I can therefore publish; however, I can't say it's a big priority right now.

# NOTE: This project is NOT in active development.

This project has not been touched since **May 8, 2012**. I wasn't using Git at the time, but I'm going through and putting my old code on GitHub for the following reasons:

1. as a general personal archive of my own code-based projects
2. to showcase the wide variety of work I have done for professional purposes
3. to make my work available to others to reuse รก la open-source

Please don't contact me with bug reports, submit pull requests, etc. You are free to fork this repository and expand on this project if you like (in accordance with the Apache v2 license), but in that case you are responsible for maintaining your fork, including bugs that may (and probably do) exist in my code.
